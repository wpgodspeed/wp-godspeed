## Description

WP Godspeed is an instant bolt-on CDN plugin for WordPress.

WP Godspeed makes your site load really fast, by offloading static resources (such as images, audio/video, archives, etc.) to your site's very own lightning fast global CDN.

While most caching plugins will enable the use of a CDN, WP Godspeed *is* the CDN service. It's super easy to setup & use on all of your WordPress sites, with a one click setup process.

It includes 5GB of transfer for free every month, and upgrade plans start at $12 for 25GB.

The plugin intentionally does not mess with CSS or JS files, so there's very little risk for breaking your site.
